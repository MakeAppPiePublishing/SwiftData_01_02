## 01_02 Add a model
**Objective:** By the end of the video the learner will be able to convert a struct to a readable form for SwiftData  

This is an exercise file of the [SwiftData Essential Training]() course on LinkedIn Learning. 

I've stored the file as a `.zip` files. This has both beginning and the end states of the exercise app. It may also contain other resources you need for the project. 

Decompress it, and use the files accordingly and to the directions of the video.
